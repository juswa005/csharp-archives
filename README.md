Got it! Here’s a **clean C# README** that only covers the files you specified — **no WinForms**, just **console-based OOP lessons and projects**:

# 💻 C# Projects & Activities

This repository contains a collection of my **C# projects and coding exercises** from my freshman year of college. These projects demonstrate my progression in **problem-solving, object-oriented programming, and console application development**, as well as my growing understanding of software design principles.

## 🗂️ Project Categories

### 1. Freshman Projects

During my 2nd semester of my freshman year, I focused on **fundamentals of C# programming**, including:

* Basic syntax and data types
* Control structures (loops, conditionals)
* Methods and modular programming
* Arrays and simple classes/objects

**Example Projects:**

* **Console Calculator**
* **Student Record System**

These projects allowed me to practice **writing structured code**, **using classes and methods**, and **handling simple input/output** in C#.

## 📌 Notes

* This repository serves as a **personal archive of my C# learning journey**.
* All projects and lessons are **console-based** and beginner-friendly.
* Many files include **comments and documentation** for easier understanding.
* The lessons progress naturally from **basic syntax → loops → methods → classes and objects**, building a solid foundation in C#.
